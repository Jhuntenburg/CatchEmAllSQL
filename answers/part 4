Part 4: Final Report
Directions: Write a query that returns the following collumns:

Pokemon Name	Trainer Name	Level	Primary Type	Secondary Type
Pokemon's name	Trainer's name	Current Level	Primary Type Name	Secondary Type Name
Sort the data by finding out which trainer has the strongest pokemon so that this will act as a ranking of strongest to weakest trainer. You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want, but you will have to explain your decision.

Select p.name AS "Pokemon Name",
        t.trainername AS "Trainer Name",
       pt.pokelevel AS "Level" ,
       tp.name AS "Primary Type",
       ts.name AS "Secondary Type"
FROM pokemons p
JOIN pokemon_trainer pt ON p.id = pt.pokemon_id
JOIN trainers t ON pt.trainerID = t.trainerID
JOIN types tp ON p.primary_type = tp.id
LEFT JOIN types ts ON p.secondary_type = ts.id
ORDER BY pt.pokelevel DESC;


list in order of poke level.
